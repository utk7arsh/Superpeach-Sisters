# Superpeach-Sisters

## Introduction

Super Peach Sisters is set in the Mushroom Queendom, fictional land of crazy creatures
like fire-breathing piranhas, koopas and goombas. Unfortunately, last week Mario was
taken hostage by the evil greenhouse gas producer named Yerac Grebnehcan (who is well
known for producing huge amounts of methane), and Peach must face a number of
increasingly difficult levels to rescue him.

Each level contains a number of challenges, which include dangerous koopas, goombas,
and fire-breathing Piranhas that grow from pipes. Peach must avoid or destroy these
creatures to reach the flag on each level, which takes her to the next level. Once Peach
reaches the final level, she must then get to Mario to save him and win the game. Each
level contains a number of goodies that Peach can reveal by bonking her head against
blocks. These goodies include Stars (which grant invincibility to Peach), Mushrooms
(which enable Peach to double her jumping height), and Flowers which enables Peach to
shoot fireballs at her opponents.

## Game Details

In Super Peach Sisters, Peach starts out a new game with three lives and continues to play
until all of her lives have been exhausted. There are multiple levels in Super Peach
Sisters, beginning with level 1 (NOT zero), and during each level except for the last
Peach must reach a flag to continue to the next level. On the last level, Peach must reach
(and thus save) Mario in order to win the entire game (there is no flag on the last level).

Peach may move left or right, and may also jump. Because of the strange physics of the
Mushroom Queendom, Peach can actually move left and right while jumping in the air as
well, which makes it easier for her to jump from platform to platform.

There are three different types of goodies: star goodies, mushroom goodies and flower
goodies. Star goodies give Peach invincibility for a limited amount of time, so she canâ€™t
be injured by coming into contact with enemies like koopas, goombas, piranhas, or
piranha fireballs. Mushroom goodies give Peach the ability to jump extra high, allowing
her to reach platforms that would otherwise be out of reach. Finally, flower goodies
enable Peach to shoot fireballs to destroy her enemies. 

More details regarding the game mechanics is given in the spec file

## Creator Notes

This is my submission for the Project 3 of Computer Science 32 : Intro to CS 2 taught by professor Smallberg in Winter 2022.
I got a perfect score in the project for building a game exactly according to the spec. You can find my other CS 32 submissions
